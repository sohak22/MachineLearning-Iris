# MachineLearning-Iris
Using Machine Learning basics, file contains Function to recieve inputs and be used to predict items (example: model recieves an image it is then able to predict what it is to determine if it is safe to publish, Detect types of Iris plant throught Machine Learning etc)
Involves basic steps: 
  1. Importing data
  2. Splitting Data (Training set/Test set)
  3. Creating a Model 
  4. Checking the Output
  5. Improving the Model
